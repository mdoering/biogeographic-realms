# Decision log

Every change to a method or threshold, dated, with its reason. The design is in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).

## 2026-10-31

- Kingdom clash narrowed to Animalia, Plantae and Fungi. Verbatim names like `Metazoa` and real disagreements like Chromista
  against Plantae aren't wrong matches, whereas a plant record matched to an animal homonym is.
- Family split seed fixed at `20261031`, before anything was clustered.
- Weight of a genus or family link is `1 - log k / log K` (k cells occupied, K cells in total), checked against the formula in
  Infomap Bioregions 2. Species links keep weight 1, as in that paper.

### Reproducing Castro-Insua et al. 2018 on Costello's matrix

- Reproduced with their method: 1,759 cells with at least 5 species, Simpson dissimilarity, R `hclust` with `ward.D2`. ANOSIM R
  matches their Figure 1 within 0.015 at all 12 points read from it, including the peak at k=7 (0.442), and the k=7 map matches
  their Figure 2a realm for realm. One of their statements doesn't hold exactly: Ward doesn't beat average for every k above 6,
  as they tie at k=16, which their own Figure 1 also shows.
- **The published map isn't unique.** 55.5% of cell pairs have a dissimilarity of exactly 1, so Ward's tree depends on how ties
  break. On the same distances, SciPy agrees with R at a V-measure of only 0.755. Shuffling the order of the cells gives 0.583
  to 0.768 against R's map, and ANOSIM R from 0.318 to 0.433 against R's 0.442. Any single Ward tree on these data is one draw
  from many.
- Consequence: Ward on beta-sim can't serve as a single-run cross-check or fallback. During exploration, try a consensus over
  shuffled cell orders, and report the spread between orders either way.
- `hierarchical_labels` uses `cut_tree`, as `fcluster` returns fewer than k groups when merge heights tie.
